    "Resume": "Resume Tip: Do not list skills you cannot justify. Use the 'X-Y-Z' formula: 'Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]'. Example: 'Reduced API latency by 20% by implementing Redis caching'.",
    "System_Design": "Start broad (High Level Design) then go deep. Always discuss Trade-offs (e.g., consistency vs availability). Never jump straight to specific tools like 'Kafka' without justifying the need for a message queue.",
    "HR_Round": "Be honest but positive. Never say 'I have no weaknesses'. Say 'I struggle with X, but I am fixing it by doing Y'. Always research the company's recent news before the call.",
    "DSA_Approach": "Don't code immediately. 1. Clarify constraints (input size, range). 2. Discuss Brute Force. 3. Optimize approach. 4. Dry run with a sample case. 5. Only then, write code.",
    "Code_Quality": "Write production-ready code. Use meaningful variable names (`userIndex` instead of `i`). Modularize logic into helper functions. Handle edge cases (null, empty inputs) explicitly.",
    "Introduction": "Keep 'Tell me about yourself' to 90 seconds. Structure: Current Status -> Past relevant experience/projects -> Why you want this role. Don't recite your bio-data.",
    "Stuck_In_Interview": "Silence is the enemy. If you are stuck, think out loud. Say, 'I am thinking of using a Hashmap to store counts, but I am worried about space complexity.' The interviewer is there to help, give them a chance.",
    "Questions_For_Interviewer": "Never say 'No questions'. Ask intelligent questions: 'What is the biggest technical challenge the team is facing?' or 'How does the team handle code reviews?'.",
    "Time_Complexity": "Always proactively state Time and Space complexity after solving. Don't wait to be asked. If you used O(N) space, justify why it was necessary.",
    "Project_Explanation": "Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Focus 70% of the time on the 'Action' (what YOU did, not what the 'team' did) and the 'Result' (impact).",
    "Debugging": "If your code fails a test case, don't guess. Dry run the specific failing input line-by-line on paper/whiteboard. Show a systematic debugging mindset.",
    "Behavioral_Conflict": "When asked about conflict, never blame teammates. Focus on the solution. 'We had a disagreement on API design. I listened to his point, presented data on latency, and we reached a middle ground.'",
    "Object_Oriented_Design": "Adhere to SOLID principles. Specifically, ensure classes have a Single Responsibility. Don't create a 'God Class' that handles DB, UI, and Logic all at once.",
    "Database_Choice": "Don't say 'I used MongoDB because it's easy'. Say 'I chose NoSQL because the data schema was evolving and read-heavy'. Justify technical choices with requirements.",
    "Operating_Systems": "Understand the difference between a Process and a Thread. Be ready to explain Concurrency, Deadlocks, and Race Conditions with real-life examples (e.g., banking transactions).",

    "Virtual_Interview_Etiquette": "Look at the camera lens, not the screen, to simulate eye contact. Ensure your background is clean. Have a pen and paper ready for dry runs.",
    "Gap_Year_Justification": "Own your gap. 'I took a year to prepare for GATE/UPSC. While it didn't work out, it taught me discipline and I kept my coding skills sharp by building X project.'",
    "Negotiation": "If you have an offer, don't accept immediately. Express gratitude and excitement, but ask for time to review the details. If you have competing offers, mention them politely to increase leverage.",
    "System_Design_Scalability": "When asked to scale, think in layers: 1. Load Balancer. 2. Caching (Redis). 3. Database Sharding/Replication. 4. Asynchronous Processing (Queues).",
    "Mock_Interview_Analysis": "Record your mocks. Watch them to catch filler words ('um', 'like', 'actually') and body language issues (slouching, not smiling).",
    "Handling_Unknown_Questions": "If you don't know an answer (e.g., 'What is CAP theorem?'), don't bluff. Say, 'I haven't worked with that concept directly, but based on what I know about distributed systems, I assume...'",
